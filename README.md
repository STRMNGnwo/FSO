The Coding style and project architecture in Parts 1 to 3 shows a lot of variation from what would be considered as "best practices". This is because the course instruction seems to primarily focus on understanding of core concepts, and proceeds to allow refactoring of code after the necessary knowledge is gained. I have created a new branch in the Part3 folder, where the directory structure has been completely reorganised based on my understanding of node best practices, in terms of directory structure.
