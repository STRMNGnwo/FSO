The Coding style and project architecture in Part 3 may show variation from what would be considered as "best practices". This is because the course instruction seems to primarily focus on understanding of core concepts, and proceeds to allow refactoring of code after the necessary knowledge is gained. I have created a new branch ,where the directory structure of Part 3 has been completely reorganised based on my understanding of node best practices, in terms of directory structure.
